# Step by Step Tutorial - TDD for Spring-Boot with Junit 5

## What is this repository for?
This repository is a collection of _copy-pasteable_ templates that you can use for test-driving Spring Boot Microservices.

This uses [Double loop TDD](https://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/04/outside-in-development-with-double-loop-tdd) so we start with writing a failing test at a higher level and go deeper writing more granular tests before writing code.

## How to use this repository?
You can either 
* clone this repository to your machine and _copy-paste_ the tests/code to use as templates OR
* follow all the steps in the following table one by one, clicking on the link to see the exact changes to be done in each step

## Step-by-step approach to develop a Microservice
